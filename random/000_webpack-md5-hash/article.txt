Avoid using webpack-md5-hash when using long-term caching

In this article, it recommended using webpack-md5-hash-plugin to create deterministic hashes.

But this causes an issue where the file hash did not update.

Let's look at an example using Webpack and webpack-md5-hash. The code is in Github (https://github.com/newyork-anthonyng/webpack-md5-hash-example).

Include snippet of webpack.config.js

Our manifest file holds the contents of the webpack runtime. It contains references to the other hashes generated during the build.

This is what the output looks like after one build.

Now we change the contents of one of the files, and the output looks like this.

Even though the contents of the manifest file changed, the file hash itself hasn't changed.
This can cause some issues with caching.

Now let's use the same webpack.config.js file, without the webpack-md5-hash.
This is what the output looks like.

How we change the contents of one of the files, and the output looks like this.

Notice how the manifest file hash has changed. Perfect!
