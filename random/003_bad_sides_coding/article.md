Bad sides of coding

# Bootcamps are hard
You still have to do work.
There is no guarantee of a job

# Recruiters
Recruiters will email you without looking at your LinkedIn/Resume.
Once they know your experience, they will hang up

# There is no perfect code
All the bestpractices you see in school rarely exists
You will see code written by developers that are inexperienced? That are overworked? That have deadlines approaching?

# Bad developers

# Toxic Environment
Sexism
React Router issue

# The Hustle is Bad
Overworked
