# Bad sides of coding

# Introduction
I graduated from a business school with a Masters of Science in Taxation. I was a Certified Public Accountant working at a large accounting firm. I know, pretty awesome.

I got promoted to a Senior Tax Associate after 3 years and was ready to settle down. But a motorcycle accident brought me to the hospital. I was very lucky to only have minor contusions.

It was a scary moment for me. All these thoughts ran through my head as I reflected on what I had done with my life. Thinking about death has a way of doing that.

I was watching Steve Job's commencement speech. It's macabre (I finally got to use this word!)  but inspiring at the same time. I recommend everyone to watch it at least once.

One quote that stuck with me was,
“I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?" And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.”

The tax industry is very seasonal. You can spend three months working 60-80 hours a week. For the rest of the year, you have to pretend that you are working for 40 hours a week. I definitely did not want to spend the last day of my life doing taxes, and changed careers.

I had taught myself to program as a hobby in college. The most exciting part of my work life was using Microsoft Excel and learning Visual Basic. I built a macro that did some boring tax stuff, but I loved that it did all the boring stuff my coworkers didn't want to do

Side note for anyone who uses Excel at work and is thinking about programming. Teach yourself Visual Basic. It was my gateway drug to JavaScript.

I had a romantic idea of what life as a web developer would be like. I would play ping pong, eat free snacks, and find an hour or two to code while imbibing Le Croix.

I get asked about how my career transition went. I wanted to share some of the bad sides of programming that surprised me.

# Bootcamps are hard
I attended the Web Development Immersive course at General Assembly in New York. I met amazing people and great mentors/instructors.

I had the lowest of lows when I ran into a bug that my googling skills could not solve.

> Don't worry, your Googling skills will improve over time by necessity.

I had the highest of highs when I finally solved a bug and felt like a king. I was hooked.

> Don't worry, these highs will still be awesome years later.

When searching for bootcamps, I saw advertisements of 90% job placement with $100k+ salaries. A lot of students joined the bootcamp for this promise. But they thought that attendance was all that was needed for this life.

Some students slept during class. Some students were more concerned about the next happy hour than their projects. And why wouldn't they? We were all waiting for the 12 week course to end so we can get our cushy jobs.

A couple of weeks into our bootcamp, we had an alumni Q&A session. The students were all bright-eyed and excited to hear how amazing life would be.

And then one person brought everyone back to reality.

This alumni talked about classmates that took 3 months to get a job. She talked about classmates that took 6 months to get a job. She talked about classmates that are still currently looking for jobs. I know of one alumni who gave up looking for web developer jobs after a year of searching.

Her advice to us was to hustle. Learning what REST API's and MySQL are might be hard. But going out into the job market was going to get harder.

What made each student different from the rest?

TLDR; Just because a bootcamp advertises a high placement rate doesn't mean you don't have to work hard.

# Recruiters are awesome, if you find a good one
The job search that came after graduating from Bootcamp was miserable. My daily routine involved going through a dozen job posting sites. I kept track of all the job listings that I applied to in a spreadsheet. I highlighted rejections in yellow. Weeks into the search, it was depressing watching my spreadsheet grow into a sea of yellow.

I was too introverted to attend Meetups and network.

> Advice for those scared of meeting new people; stop it! Go there and talk with one person. You will never know what will happen if you do this. But you will know what will happen if you don't.

I would get shimmers of hope when I got a phone call. I would rush to get a pen and paper to write down a prospective interview date.

My phone conversations would go like this:

Me 😀 : Hello, this is Anthony speaking.

Recruiter : Hi Anthony. Yada yada yada, tell me about your work experience.

Me 😀 : Oh, I went through a coding bootcamp for 12 weeks. I learned to build a full stack application, using Angular and Express, with a Mongo database.

Recruiter : Oh...ummm...do you have any ~~real~~ experience?

Me 😀 : Ummm...no.

Recruiter : Okay, I'll contact you if I get an interview date.

Me What??

I would get a number of these calls, and I wondered if going to bootcamp was the right choice. It was frustrating to have invested all this time and money. But it wasn't getting recognized by these recruiters. My frustrations eventually crept into my phone conversations with them.

Me 😠 : Hello, this is Anthony.

Recruiter : Hi Anthony. Yada yada yada, tell me about your work experience.

Me 😠 : Did you have my resume?

Recruiter : Ummm...yeah I do. Give me a minute.

Me 😠 : Okay...

Recruiter : Oh...I see you only have 12 weeks of experience. We were looking for someone more experienced.

Me 😠 : Did you even look at my resume? I'm trying to understand why you're even calling me.

Recruiter : No, sorry...

I feel bad for how I acted during those phone conversations. I had devolved into a grouch only weeks into my job search. I cannot imagine how hard it is for those months into their job search, right out of bootcamp.

Ironically, I was introduced to a recruiter who helped me find my second and third contractor gigs. She actually met up with me over a cup of tea. She actually read my resume and learned about me. From my limited experience, good recruiters are hard to come by.

Tldr; the job search is going to be hard! Having these recruiter calls like I did just felt like rubbing salt on my wounds.

* All the best practices you see in school rarely exists
* You will see code written by developers that are inexperienced? That are overworked? That have deadlines approaching?
