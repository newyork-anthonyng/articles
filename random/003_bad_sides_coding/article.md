# Bad sides of coding

# My background
* Work background
* How did I transition to bootcamp?

I graduated from Baruch College, a business school, with a Masters in Taxation. I got a full-time job at a big accounting firm, I got my CPA, and was ready to pump out tax returns like it was nobody's business.

I worked three years, just got promoted to a Senior Tax Associate, and was ready to settle down. But then a motorcycle accident brought me to the hospital. I was very lucky and only had minor contusions.
This was a big wake-up call for me. All these thoughts went through me head.
Am I really happy with my job? https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/412696-i-have-looked-in-the-mirror-every-morning-and-asked
There were never any days where I was excited about the work that I was going to do. During the tax busy season, people would be encouraged to work 60-80 hours a week. I was definitely not excited during those times.
During non busy season, people had to pretend to work 40 hours a week. I was not excited during these times either.

And this is when I decided to change careers and become a web developer. I had always done programming as a passion.
I had such a romantic idea of what life as a web developer would be like. I still consider myself new in the programming world, but don't read as much about some of the bad sides of programming.

# Bootcamps are hard
* You still have to do work
* There is no guarantee of a job

# Recruiters
* Recruiters will email you without looking at your LinkedIn/Resume.
* Once they know your experience, they will hang up

# There is no perfect code
* All the best practices you see in school rarely exists
* You will see code written by developers that are inexperienced? That are overworked? That have deadlines approaching?

# Bad developers

# Toxic Environment
* Sexism
* React Router issue

# The Hustle is Bad
Overworked
Burnout
