# Bad sides of coding

# My background
* Work background
* How did I transition to bootcamp?

I graduated from Baruch College, a business school, with a Masters in Taxation. I got a full-time job at a big accounting firm, I got my CPA, and was ready to pump out tax returns like it was nobody's business.

I worked three years, just got promoted to a Senior Tax Associate, and was ready to settle down. But then a motorcycle accident brought me to the hospital. I was very lucky and only had minor contusions.
This was a big wake-up call for me. All these thoughts went through me head.
Am I really happy with my job? https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/412696-i-have-looked-in-the-mirror-every-morning-and-asked
There were never any days where I was excited about the work that I was going to do. During the tax busy season, people would be encouraged to work 60-80 hours a week. I was definitely not excited during those times.
During non busy season, people had to pretend to work 40 hours a week. I was not excited during these times either.

And this is when I decided to change careers and become a web developer. I had always done programming as a passion.
I had such a romantic idea of what life as a web developer would be like. I still consider myself new in the programming world, but don't read as much about some of the bad sides of programming.

# Bootcamps are hard
* You still have to do work
* There is no guarantee of a job

To start my career change, I went searching for a Bootcamp. I attended General Assembly in New York. Here, I learned the basics of web development.
I met amazing people, had great mentors, had the highest of highs when I could solve bugs, and the lowest of lows when I couldn't.
After going through the 12 week course, I was hooked.

This was different than college for me. I paid attention in every class and was itching to learn more.
In college, the lectures were more of a chore. I have to say that I might have fallen asleep for a couple of business lectures. Taxes can be quite dry.
But I wasn't worried about breezing through college. The job interviews for fresh graduates were quite tame. Interview questions consisted of behavioral questions.
Tell me about yourself.
Tell me about a time when you worked with someone difficult.
If you ran out of paper in the printer, how would you handle it?
These situations were ones that you could come up with solutions to easily.
I don't think I ever faced technical questions in any of my business interviews. They took a look at my resume, and took it for face value.

This was a big change for me when I had to think about technical interviews.
Books have been published about how hard it was interviewing at Google. (https://www.amazon.com/Are-Smart-Enough-Work-Google/dp/0316099988)
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-i-studied-full-time-for-8-months-for-a-google-interview-cc662ce9bb13
Someone studied 8 months to get into Google and blogged about their experience.

What separated me from all the rest of these candidates going for jobs?

Going to a bootcamp is a huge investment of time and money. I felt like I had a lot of catching up to do; I was 3 years behind others who had graduated with a CS degree.
I had to study more and prove myself.

But others in the bootcamps fell asleep.
I think the bootcamp advertisements of 90% employment made them feel comfortable. A lot of people dreamed of earning 6 figure jobs after completing the 12 week course.

However, reality hit when we had an alumni session. Imagine a room full of 100 bootcamp students in varying stages of completion. They were all bright-eyed and excited at their future of the 6 figure job. 
The panel was asked to give advice; and one woman brought everyone back to reality.
> You've got to hustle. 
There were people that graduated with her that were still looking for jobs. Even after 6 months. Even after a year. You've got to hustle and work hard.

Lesson learned: Just because a bootcamp advertises a high employment rate, doesn't mean you dont' have to work.

# Recruiters
* Recruiters will email you without looking at your LinkedIn/Resume.
* Once they know your experience, they will hang up

# There is no perfect code
* All the best practices you see in school rarely exists
* You will see code written by developers that are inexperienced? That are overworked? That have deadlines approaching?

# Bad developers

# Toxic Environment
* Sexism
* React Router issue
