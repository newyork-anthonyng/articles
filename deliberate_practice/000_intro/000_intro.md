I have been reading a lot of self-improvement books, and finished Cal Newport's "So Good they can't ignore you".

It introduced me to the concept of Deliberate Practice

People who say they have 20 years of experience, generally mean they have 20 years of the same experience.

They do the same routine and don't push themselves.

The author, Cal Newport, found that he plateaued after graduating from university.

To keep growing and improving, he took to studying academic papers to challenge himself.

A good metaphor of this is going to the gym. If you don't push yourself to lift heavier and heavier weights, you won't see growth. After a certain time, you'll never improve.

In Corbett Barr's article, [Deliberate Practice: What It Is and Why You Need It], he says that expert performance is primarily a result of expert-level practice and not talent.

In my quest to improve myself, I am going to start dissecting, studying, and hopefully contributing back to Open Source projects.

Please leave a comment if anyone else is already doing this, or any other deliberate practice techniques you have.
