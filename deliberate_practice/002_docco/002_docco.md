* What is docco?
  * a tool for creating literate programming guides
  * include tutorial for how to use it
* What is literate programming?
  * Link to the annotated source code of underscore
  * Expressing programming logic in plain language
  * I like to think of it as pseudocode
* Taking things apart and putting them back together
  * invest time in creating a short feedback loop
    * it may be running a test suite
    * it my case, it was adding console.log statements. It gave me instant feedback
    * I would not suggest trying to take apart a project until you have a way to get short feedback
  * link to my commented version of docco
  * pepper the src code with your own comments
    * notice all the console.logs that I have there
  * Kent Dodds said that you should work on Open Source projects that you will use
    * created my own version of docco-lite because maintenance of docco seemed to be dead
    * fun learning experience
    * I created docco-lite, which I published to npm (which was a good learning experience in its own right)
* Literate programming as a way of lowering the barrier for new developers to contribute.
  * I believe it is valuable in lowering the barrier for new developers to contribute.
    * There are a lot of intimidating factors when first starting out on an Open Source project
      * directory structure
      * code of conduct
      * setting up environment
      * grokking the source code logic
  * I have conflicting feelings about it if it should be standard on all Open Source projects, such as a Code of Conduct should be
    * more maintenance
    * well written comments and tests code do the same thing. But it would take longer
* Awesome libraries exist outside of the browser as well
  * Working in the frontend world, I know that there are no shortages of libraries and frameworks available to me
  * There exists the same type of environment working with CLI
    * fs-extra (include brief intro)
    * commander (include brief intro)
    * chalk (include brief intro)
  * as a web developer, I primarly work in the browser
  * it was a nice change creating a CLI tool
* JavaScript Templates
  * After primarily working in React, it is refreshing to go back to using templates
  * The syntax was refreshing, and effective
* Create valuable PRs
  * link to project defining UMD.
    * show README.md
    * this might be a great chance to update README.md
    * do not blindly create a PR
    * there are a dozen PRs all addressing the same thing
    * create issues before spending time on a PR that will not get accepted
      * be sure to search through previous issues to make sure there are no duplicates as well
