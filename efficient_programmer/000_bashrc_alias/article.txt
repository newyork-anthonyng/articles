Use bashrc alias to become a more efficient programmer

There are situations where you type in long command strings into your terminal.

This can become error prone and tiring.

The ~/.bashrc file is a configuration file for your terminal.
Open up your ~/.bashrc file and type:
`alias hello='echo Hello World 👋 🌎'`
[image](typing alias command into bashrc file)

Try typing “hello” in your terminal, and notice that it does not work.
[image](terminal showing command is not valid)

To see any changes from your ~/.bashrc file, you need to restart your terminal.

Notes: You may have seen “rc” in other contexts, such as a “.babelrc” file. The rc stands for “run commands”, and contains startup information for a command.
